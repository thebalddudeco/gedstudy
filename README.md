# GED Prep Hub

## Implementation plan

This project is being built as a fully local GED prep app that runs by opening `index.html` in a browser.

Build sequence:

1. Create the offline-friendly shell, navigation, shared state, and persistence.
2. Add reusable quiz flows that can power subject drills, diagnostics, and timed exams.
3. Layer in dashboard, diagnostics, and progress analytics driven by real study state.
4. Populate full subject banks with passages, explanations, and filterable skills.
5. Finish essay tools, study plans, Montana guidance, bookmarks, retake flows, and polish.

## Current structure

- `index.html`: app shell and section layout
- `styles.css`: theme, layout, components, charts, and responsive rules
- `app.js`: state management, rendering, persistence, quiz engine, analytics, timers
- `data/passages.js`: core reading/source passages
- `data/questions.js`: base metadata and seed questions
- `data/license-registry.js`: hashed Gumroad license allowlist for the hosted soft gate
- `data/math-bank.js`: full Math bank
- `data/rla-bank.js`: full RLA bank and added passages
- `data/science-bank.js`: full Science bank
- `data/social-studies-bank.js`: full Social Studies bank
- `data/mixed-bank.js`: mixed/full-bank practice questions
- `data/essays.js`: base essay lab content
- `data/essay-bank.js`: extended essay prompt bank and examples
- `data/study-plans.js`: study plan schedules and pacing data
- `license-helper.html`: local seller tool for generating hashed buyer entries from Gumroad email + license key pairs

## Depth upgrades in this build

- Subject banks now expose deeper structure through domain groupings, skill-level coverage maps, and per-skill quick-start actions.
- Dashboard and Progress Tracker include study-activity bars, readiness drivers, difficulty-level performance, wrong-answer queues, bookmark queues, and richer exam reports.
- Practice surfaces are designed to help students decide what to do next, not just accumulate scores.

## Local usage

1. Keep all files in the same folder structure.
2. Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser.
3. Progress is saved in `localStorage` under the app storage key.

## Gumroad license gate workflow

1. Turn on license keys for the Gumroad product.
2. For each buyer, open `license-helper.html`.
3. Enter the buyer email and Gumroad license key, then generate a hash entry.
4. Paste the generated object into `activeLicenses` inside `data/license-registry.js`.
5. Generate and keep one owner test entry for yourself before launch so you can verify the hosted unlock flow any time.
6. Upload the updated files to GitHub so the hosted app can verify the buyer entry.
7. To revoke access later, move that buyer hash into `revokedLicenseHashes` and upload the updated registry file again.

This is a GitHub-only soft gate, not true server-side access control, but it is stronger than a shared password because each buyer can have a separate license entry.

This workflow is manual: when a new Gumroad sale happens, you update `data/license-registry.js` and upload the refreshed files so the hosted app recognizes that buyer.
